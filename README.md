# Syntactic_WM
This is a repository of Jupyter notebooks and Python code behind our manuscript - Syntax through Hebbian synapses.

Here, you will find all the necessary machinery to perform simulations outlined in our paper.

We have divided the Results section of our paper into individual stand-alone Jupyer notebooks.

By working through each notebook, you will gain a full understanding of how each of our simulations is performed.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that you have the following dependencies in your Python environment: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`. <br>
2. Download the Jupyter notebooks and syntactic_wm.py (and syntactic_wm_SC_1.py and syntactic_wm_SC_2.py for soft constraint simulations (Simulation S2)). <br>
3. Save the downloaded files into the same folder. <br>
4. Open a Jupyter notebook and run in a Python environment. <br>
5. Play

## Jupyter notebooks

We have provided 6 notebooks - 

**[Simulation of simple grammar](https://github.com/linsun2020/Syntactic_WM/blob/main/Simulation%20of%20simple%20grammar.ipynb)**: simulations of the simplest grammar. <br>
**[Morphemic language](https://github.com/linsun2020/Syntactic_WM/blob/main/Morphemic%20language.ipynb)**: simulation of order-free language with morpheme neurons. <br>
**[Aphasias](https://github.com/linsun2020/Syntactic_WM/blob/main/Aphasias.ipynb)**: simulation of agrammatic (Broca) and paragrammatic (Wernicke) aphasias, with serialisation. <br>
**[Priming](https://github.com/linsun2020/Syntactic_WM/blob/main/Priming.ipynb)**: lexical and syntactic priming experiments during comprehension. <br>
**[Bock experiment](https://github.com/linsun2020/Syntactic_WM/blob/main/Bock%20experiment.ipynb)**: simulation of Bock's experiment from 1986. <br>
**[Long term encoding](https://github.com/linsun2020/Syntactic_WM/blob/main/Long%20term%20encoding.ipynb)**: acquisition of long-term semantic and syntactic knowledge with our model. <br>
**EEG simulation** is contained in sanjay_replication.py
